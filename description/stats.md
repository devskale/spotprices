## Austrian Energy Spot Price Analysis Module: Implementation Specification

### Overview

This document specifies a Python module for analyzing Austrian energy spot price data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to energy consumers. The module will provide insights on price patterns, volatility, and potential savings opportunities.

### Input Data Requirements

- Data source: Hourly spot price data from the Austrian energy market
- Required fields: timestamp (datetime) and price (float, in EUR/MWh or EUR/kWh)
- Minimum dataset: Prefer at least 12 months of historical data for seasonal analysis

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Average Price Analysis

- Calculate average prices across multiple time frames:
  - All-time average (or whatever timeframe is available in the database)
  - Monthly averages for the past 12 months (for trend visibility)
  - Last month average (for recent performance)
  - Last week average (for immediate situation awareness)
  - Custom date range option for user-defined periods

#### 2. Volatility Analysis

- Calculate price standard deviation across different periods:
  - Weekly volatility metrics for the past 3 months
  - Weekday vs. weekend volatility comparison
  - Day (8am-8pm) vs. night (8pm-8am) volatility comparison
  - Month-to-month volatility trend

#### 3. Peak/Off-Peak Analysis

- Compare peak and off-peak pricing patterns:
  - Define peak hours as 8am-8pm on weekdays (configurable)
  - Calculate average peak vs. off-peak price ratio
  - Track monthly changes in peak/off-peak differential
  - Identify optimal hours for energy consumption

#### 4. Pattern & Trend Analysis

- Identify recurring patterns in price data:
  - Hourly profile (average price by hour of day)
  - Daily profile (average price by day of week)
  - Seasonal patterns (monthly averages)
  - Anomaly detection for unusual price events

#### 5. Trend Analysis

- Calculate specific trend metrics:
  - Weekly trends (7-day moving average with rate of change)
  - Short-term trends (last 3 months, weekly granularity)
  - Year-over-year comparison (same week/month vs. previous year)
  - Linear and non-linear trend modeling
  - Trend acceleration/deceleration indicators

#### 6. Potential Savings Analysis

- Calculate metrics related to cost-saving opportunities:
  - Negative price frequency (count and percentage of hours)
  - Hours below average price (percentage and average discount)
  - Comparison against a reference fixed tariff
  - Potential savings from optimal load shifting
  - Best and worst hours to consume energy

### Output Format

- Results should be returned as structured Python dictionaries
- Each metric should include both raw values and percentage changes
- Time series data should include timestamps for plotting
- Values should be rounded to appropriate precision (2 decimal places for prices)

### Visualization Support (Optional)

- Generate standard plots for each KPI category:
  - Line charts for time series data
  - Heatmaps for hourly/daily patterns
  - Bar charts for comparative analysis
  - Export options to PNG, PDF, and interactive HTML

### Configuration Options

- Allow user-defined parameters for:
  - Peak/off-peak hour definitions
  - Reference fixed tariff for comparison
  - Time period selection
  - Output units (EUR/MWh or EUR/kWh)
  - Weekday/weekend definitions

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for datasets with up to 3 years of hourly data (26,280 data points)
- Use efficient pandas operations for large dataset handling
- Implement caching for repeated analysis on the same dataset

### Implementation Suggestions

#### Integration with Existing Architecture

- Create a new `spot_price_analyzer.py` module in the `utils/` directory for core statistical functions
- Add database operations in `db/operations/price_analytics.py` for retrieving and processing data
- Expose analysis capabilities through new FastAPI endpoints in `electricity/routers/analytics.py`
- Enhance chart generation in `utils/chart.py` to visualize the new metrics
- Extend WordPress plugin templates to display analysis results
- Add configuration options in `config.py` for analysis parameters

#### Class Structure

- Create a main `SpotPriceAnalyzer` class that handles the core analysis logic
- Implement separate strategy classes for each analysis type (averages, volatility, trends, etc.)
- Use a factory pattern to configure different analysis time ranges (week, month, year)
- Implement caching decorators to optimize repeated calculations

#### Database Considerations

- Store calculated metrics in the `daily_stats` table for quick retrieval
- Implement incremental updates to avoid recalculating entire dataset
- Create appropriate indexes on timestamp columns for efficient time-range queries

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement data validation and preprocessing
2. Build core statistical analysis functions
3. Create pattern recognition algorithms
4. Develop savings calculation methods
5. Add visualization capabilities
6. Implement export/reporting features

### Dependencies

- Required packages: pandas, numpy
- Optional packages: matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
